## 🐍 Snake Game
This is a classic Snake Game, inspired by the game many of us played on old Nokia phones.
I really enjoyed building this project because it reminded me of my childhood 😊.

## ✨ Features 
- The snake grows by one segment each time it eats food
- Displays the current player’s score
- Saves and displays the highest score

## Tools I used
- python(programming language)
- git and github
- pycharm as IDE

## ▶️ How to Run
1. Clone the repository
2. Make sure Python is installed
3. Run:
   python main.py

## Future Improvements
- Improve the game with more advanced features (levels, speed increase, better UI, etc.)
- Anyone who is interested in improving the game is welcome to contribute
